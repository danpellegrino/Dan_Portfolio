# About Me

Hi I'm Daniel Pellegrino, I'm currently a sophomore Computer & Information Sciences student attending SUNY Polytechnic Institute. I've had a background in coding since my freshman year in high school and have been working on multiple projects over that timespan.

Over these past few years, I've self-taught myself coding techniques ontop of the ones I've learned in college.

My preferred coding languages are Java, Javascript, and C/C++. I'm proficent in Python and like to do web development on the side as well.
